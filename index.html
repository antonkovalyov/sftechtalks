      <h2><a href="irisheich.html">innerHTML's storied past, and HTML's shiny future</a> by Paul Irish</h2>

      <p>
        The special relationship between your HTML markup and browsers is one more
        interesting than you'd think. In this talk, Paul will cover pedantic differences
        like "elements" vs "tags" but also get into what it means that HTML is both markup
        and a serialization but definitely not the DOM. You'll also learn shortcuts with
        HTML that save you time. In the end, you'll have a better understanding browser
        internals and how they interpret your work.

      <h2><a href="irisheich.html">JavaScript World Domination, Day 5,935</a> by Brendan Eich</h2>

      <p>
        Thanks to browser competition combined with awesome JavaScript developer communities
        and github.com-focused code culture, JavaScript is evolving rapidly. The 6th edition
        of ECMAScript (ECMA-262), the JavaScript standard, is under construction. I will present
        what is in ES6 for sure, what is hot but not yet in, and what is already implemented in
        certain browsers whose names might start with 'C' and 'F'. As usual, I will also tell
        some history and try to paint the big picture.

      <h2><a href="zakas.html">Progressive Enhancement 2.0 &mdash; Because the Web isn't Print</a> by Nicholas Zakas</h2>

      <p>
        In the beginning, progressive enhancement was simple: HTML layered
        with CSS layered with JavaScript. That worked fine when there were two
        browsers, but in today's world of multiple devices and multiple
        browsers, it's time for a progressive enhancement reboot. At the core
        is the understanding that the web is not print - the same rules don't
        apply. As developers and consumers we've been fooled into thinking about
        print paradigms for too long. In this talk, you'll learn just how
        different the web is and how the evolution of progressive enhancement
        can lead to better user experiences as well as happier developers and
        users.
