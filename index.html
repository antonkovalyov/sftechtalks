        The special relationship between your HTML markup and browsers is one more
        interesting than you'd think. In this talk, Paul will cover pedantic differences
        like "elements" vs "tags" but also get into what it means that HTML is both markup
        and a serialization but definitely not the DOM. You'll also learn shortcuts with
        HTML that save you time. In the end, you'll have a better understanding browser
        internals and how they interpret your work.

        JavaScript World Domination, Day 5,935

      <p>
        Thanks to browser competition combined with awesome JavaScript developer communities
        and github.com-focused code culture, JavaScript is evolving rapidly. The 6th edition
        of ECMAScript (ECMA-262), the JavaScript standard, is under construction. I will present
        what is in ES6 for sure, what is hot but not yet in, and what is already implemented in
        certain browsers whose names might start with 'C' and 'F'. As usual, I will also tell
        some history and try to paint the big picture.
