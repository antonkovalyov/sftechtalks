      <h2>
        Progressive Enhancement 2.0 &mdash; Because the Web isn't Print
        <cite>by&nbsp;Nicholas&nbsp;Zakas</cite>
      </h2>

      <p>
        In the beginning, progressive enhancement was simple: HTML layered
        with CSS layered with JavaScript. That worked fine when there were two
        browsers, but in today's world of multiple devices and multiple
        browsers, it's time for a progressive enhancement reboot. At the core
        is the understanding that the web is not print - the same rules don't
        apply. As developers and consumers we've been fooled into thinking about
        print paradigms for too long. In this talk, you'll learn just how
        different the web is and how the evolution of progressive enhancement
        can lead to better user experiences as well as happier developers and
        users.
